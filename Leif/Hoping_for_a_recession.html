    <h1>Hoping for a recession</h1>
    <p>Published: December 27, 2025</p>
    
    <p>I recently fell in love with a paper by Andrew Gordon Wilson entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02113"> "Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different" </a>
        which I not only find to be a great title but but also a deeply thought-provoking piece of work. Essentially, Wilson argues 
        that the strange generalization behaviour observed for LLMs (or in fact any large transformer architecture) of <em>double descent</em>
        is in fact not so strange after all given you can observe the very same phenomenon for much simpler models too.

    <b>Embracing flatland and the bliss of dimensionality</b>
    
    <p>Some of the deepest insights to me come from looking at these findings from a Bayesian perspective, which Wilson had actually done in a previous paper in 2022 
        "Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Persepective on Generalization". In that paper, Wilson and Izmailov argue for the preeminence of marginalization 
        to understand inductive bias and why some models perform better than others. The marginal likelihood says how likely it is that we would sample the data 
        \(\mathcal{D}\) given a prior over parameters \(p(w)\) which induces a distribution over models \(p(\mathcal{M})\), i.e.  
    </p>
    \[ p(\mathcal{D}|\mathcal{M}) = \int p(\mathcal{D}|\mathcal{M}, w)p(w)\, dw\]

    <p>Wilson and Izmailov then define the inductive bias of a model as just that: the distribution of the support or \(p(\mathcal{D}|\mathcal{M})\), i.e. which 
        hypotheses are supported and which are supported more than others. A good model hence might have very large support but has an inductive bias such that 
        the right hypotheses (e.g. an equivariant solution over a non-symmetric one) get favoured. If we look at the probability mass of that inductive bias, the 
        majority of the distribution will be at the correct hypothesis, in other words, sampling from this distribution means we're much more likely to get back our 
        data set. Compare this to a distribution with the same support but that is much flatter (i.e. no inductive bias at all), sampling from this distribution will 
        only gives us a small chance of recovering our original data set.
    </p>
    <p>We can now understand how Bayesian marginalization actually implicitly enforces simplicity: Simpler solutions will have more probability mass at the places 
        of the actual data, i.e. the marginal likelihood of sampling our data set from such a distribution is much higher. In other words, maximizing marginal 
        likelihood will favour simplicity if the underlying data lets itself be represented in simple ways. Interesing isn't it? 
    </p>
    <p>Finally, we know that big models typically converge on some flat solution space and that flat solutions are associated with models that generalize well. This 
        becomes pretty intuitive now. Two things are also true about flat subspaces in high dimensions: (i.) these flat subspaces make up a lot of the volume 
        in higher dimensions and (ii.) they are easily compressible. So finding a flat subspace with low loss is good in two ways: (i.) the marginal likelihood will 
        be very high as this is a good solution that also has a lot of probability mass for this solution (i.e. has the right inductive bias); and (ii.) this will be 
        a comparitively simple solution as it many different degenerate hypotheses exist in this flat space and hence the solution is quite compressible. Low training loss 
        and low Kolmogorov complexity! Double win?
